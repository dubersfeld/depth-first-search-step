# depth-first-search-step
Java based demonstration of Depth First Search algorithm using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and AJAX.

I present here a Java based demonstration of the Depth First Search algorithm. 

The algorithm itself is implemented in Java. Javascript is used for initialization and display only. 

The search itself is step-by-step, each Ajax request resulting in a new vertex discovery executed on server side.

The root context when deployed on Tomcat is depth-first-search
