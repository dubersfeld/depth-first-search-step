# depth-first-search-step
Java based demonstration of Depth First Search algorithm using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and AJAX.

I present here a Java based demonstration of the Depth First Search algorithm. 

The algorithm itself is implemented in Java. Javascript is used for initialization and display only. 

The search itself is step-by-step, each Ajax request resulting in a new vertex discovery executed on server side.

When the search is completed all edges are colored according to the DFS edge classification:

Blue for Tree edges
Green for Forward edges
Red for Backward edges
Black for Cross edges
 
The root context when deployed on Tomcat is depth-first-search
